Stranger: Hey

You: hey

Stranger: What's up?

You: Im good

You: you?

Stranger: Fine too, thanks!

You: you know you are talking to a programmer when they type fast

Stranger: Could also be a typist tbf :D

You: thats true

You: what do you program?

Stranger: but yeah, my typing speed is about average I'd imagine

Stranger: oh, I've done lots of things. ranging from IoT to Web and Mobile

Stranger: you?

You: language?

You: i do AI and data analyse in python

Stranger: nice!

Stranger: I've done Python myself for a couple of years

Stranger: it's an OK language but it has never worked its way up to my favorite language

You: and your favourite language is?

Stranger: but everyone I know rages about Jupyter Notebook and pandas

Stranger: so I guess it does have its merits

You: jupyter is so shit in my opinion

Stranger: my favorite language is Swift

You: ah

You: an Ios dev

Stranger: and Rust for that matter

You: rust looks interesting

Stranger: I like their strictness and terseness

You: made anyapps i could look at?

Stranger: but Swift is a lot more simple - but uses more resources in return

Stranger: so no, even for not-iOS I'd be a Swift guy

Stranger: I have made a couple but I wouldn't want to expose them right now

You: i thought swift was only for IOS?

Stranger: Oh no

Stranger: Swift is a general purpose programming language

You: oh wow

You: interesting

You: didnt know that

Stranger: UIKit is a framework bridging Obj-C and Apple's UI code to Swift so to say

Stranger: and that is the iOS part

You: i tried swift, i like the freedom of python

Stranger: but you can run Swift on Linux just fine

You: and windows?

Stranger: Python to me seems very broken, there are so many flaws in the implementation of the language and cpython

You: cpython? that doesnt even come with python

Stranger: Oh yes it does

Stranger: CPython is the name of the standard implementation

You: i had to install it

You: oh

You: im thinking of cython

Stranger: Swift does not yet work on windows, but I don't work with Windows so I couldn't care less.

You: thats a python to C library

Stranger: yuck, cython is a huge disgrace IMO

You: i tried it yesterday

Stranger: porting all of Cs UB to python - hooray

You: one print statment made 2k lines of c

You: that didnt woek

Stranger: sounds reasonable though

You: so do you code as a hobby? or as a job

Stranger: both

Stranger: I've transformed my hobby to be the job

You: i plan on working in software dev when i finish school

Stranger: ah I see

You: only 15 now

You: so still have a bit

Stranger: oh yeah I'm quite a bit older lol

You: 36?

Stranger: nah

You: 43

Stranger: but good guess

Stranger: oh no

You: 29

Stranger: close enough

You: its between 29 and 36

Stranger: yeah

You: lmao, ive been watching to much sherlock holmes, getting all detectivly

Stranger: yeah no worries

You: sorry

You: so how long have you been codin?

Stranger: hm, I'd say around a good 15 years now

You: wow

You: i started with html, as many do, i took a p5.js class last year and ended up teaching half the class, im doing an arduino class rn but i hate it and ive been doing python for maybe 4 months

Stranger: yeah I started with HTML too

Stranger: but that's not entirely true

Stranger: I've started with XHTML

You: and that is

Stranger: a more strict variant that makes sure your HTML document is compliant XML

You: thought so

Stranger: it was once the big hope to tackle pages with lots of errors and to make browser development easier

You: is it static?

Stranger: but it never really took off, as people just didn't care.

Stranger: Yeah.

You: or can you use it instead of JS

Stranger: it's just a more sound definition of HTML

You: right

Stranger: using an XML DTD

You: i would still call that HTML

Stranger: it isn't though

You: so you like the stricter languages

You: less forgiving languages

Stranger: HTML is unsound and can not be modeled via a sound definition

You: thats correct

Stranger: that is the big difference here

Stranger: and about strictness: yeah, I do enjoy that

Stranger: however, I also like it the other way around

Stranger: I enjoyed doing Obj-C and things like Ruby and PHP

You: i dislike some parts of python

Stranger: Obj-C being totally dynamic and having absolutely no type safety at all, Ruby being very close and PHP being what it is of course :D

You: but i dont know anything else thats as good for data

Stranger: yeah focus has truly shifted to Python these days

You: yup

You: btw can i use this chat? im building an omegle data set

Stranger: but yeah Python is .. well it's OK enough

Stranger: yeah go ahead

You: thanks

You: very difficult to find clean and long chats in omegle

Stranger: if you're into NLP, check out raza core

You: i do like NLP

Stranger: I was at the conference where they introduced it and it blew my mind

You: rasa core?

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: sorry :D

Stranger: got confused with the spelling

You: is it a language?

You: or a framework

You: or a API

You: or what

Stranger: https://rasa.com/docs/

Stranger: it's a framework for python

You: so an NLP framework

You: looks very cool

You: thank you

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: I liked their demos and their way of working a lot

Stranger: however, I don't have any use cases for AI/NLP/...

You: and why is that?

Stranger: because there is no use case in my work for that.

You: and what do you do right now?

Stranger: in the most complex cases all I need is a state machine.

Stranger: I don't need a dynamic state machine that needs to be trained - I'm not implementing recommendations or the likes

You: you freelance?

Stranger: no, I work for an agency.

You: thats cool

Stranger: so we have customers who basically have an idea of what they want to have and we do consulting, implementation and maintenance/operations.

You: i would probably do something like that

Stranger: it's a bit like freelancing just without the worries

Stranger: I get a paycheck every month no matter what's the deal

Stranger: and I have colleagues whom I can depend upon if I get sick or need a few days off.

Stranger: luxury you don't get when freelancing

You: sounds great

You: tried freelance

You: pretty bad

Stranger: I'm sure I could make double the figures if I decided to freelance, but I also like this safety net so to day

Stranger: *say

You: i feel a saftey net could be more important

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: plus I really like working in a team

Stranger: I have really strong opinions but being with other people who are different to me is a big part of learning

You: a unique perspective really helps

Stranger: and also having more than one opinion leads to the better system most of the time

Stranger: I could do most things myself but yeah - it's good not having to worry about things and being able to focus on a couple of key areas

Stranger: right now I'm in a few eCommerce projects

You: thats cool

You: i might start working on trading

Stranger: but I have to say I enjoyed embedded the most

Stranger: (so IoT in that case)

You: itlooks facinatinf

Stranger: ?

You: sorry

You: embeded looks facinating

Stranger: yeah - it's working with constraints that makes it kinda fun

You: so you love a challenge

Stranger: and a whole world of deep technicalities that you don't care for every day

You: so do i

Stranger: yeah I do

Stranger: and I get bored rather quickly

Stranger: I can't be longer than 2 years on one project

You: i doubt i could

Stranger: plus I personally thing software engineering is just that - it's 70% engineering and 30% pure art

Stranger: and striving for simplicity

You: i really agree

Stranger: getting back to strict vs. less strict languages: I have seen all the horrors bad programmers produce including myself

You: well its late here, thanks for the great conversation

Stranger: so I have the strong feeling that those errors need to be trapped before a program is run

Stranger: oh ok

Stranger: see you around

Stranger: goodbye!

You: cheers
You: Hello

Stranger: Hellogramming

You: good to find a fellow programmer

Stranger: Brogramming

You: very few of them on omegle

You: lmao

Stranger: Fellogrammer

Stranger: lmaogrammer

You: lmaogrammergrammer

You: i win\

You: this could be a bot for all i know

Stranger: So what kind of programming do you dop

Stranger: *do

You: i do data analyse with python

Stranger: Not a bot... beep

You: and you?

Stranger: Web app development right now

Stranger: With JS

You: cool

You: JS was my first proper lang

You: well i used p5.js

Stranger: What's p5?

You: its a js framework for animation/games/interactive art

You: so a visual framework for js

Stranger: Ah, cool

Stranger: Yeah I use JS just for web stuff

You: any examples to show?

Stranger: Yes but not on Omegle

You: published sites? githubs?

Stranger: Both

You: published site please

Stranger: I'm not showing it on Omegle

You: not sending a link?

Stranger: No, prefer anonymity

You: interesting, omegle was my main form of advertesing when i published my first site

You: well to each to his own

Stranger: I don't need to advertise on omegle :P

Stranger: What country are you from?

You: eh, as a 14 year old i dont have better options

You: South Africa

You: you?

Stranger: USA

You: thought so

You: wisconsin?

Stranger: Yeah a lot of Americans on Omegle

Stranger: No

You: florida

You: alabama

Stranger: Lol Wisconsin, not a very populous state, shouldn't have been your first guess

You: thats all my guesses

Stranger: Now you're just throwing out random states lol

You: no

You: my fav states

Stranger: I see

Stranger: Why Wisconsin?

You: its cool

You: cold

You: empty

Stranger: Why FL and AL?

You: memes

Stranger: Ah yeah lol

You: lmao

Stranger: The legendary "Florida Man"

You: exactly

You: a force to be recconed with

Stranger: And Alabama rednecks I guess?

You: ya

Stranger: Lol ok

You: so if not those

You: where

Stranger: Southeast

Stranger: But not either of those two states

Stranger: Anyway let's chat code

Stranger: What are you working on right now?

You: sure

You: a bot that generates omegle conversations

You: on that topic

You: may i add this conversation to my private dataset?

You: and you?

Stranger: No, but that probably won't stop you

You: that will

You: i always ask

Stranger: Ok

Stranger: Is crime etc really bad in SA?

You: i dislike taking peoples intellectual property with out consent'

You: ya

You: very

Stranger: Sucks :(

Stranger: Do you have to live in a gated community?

You: i do yes

You: but thats a first

You: normally not

Stranger: Yeah I would too if I lived there, actually I'd just move, but it's not an option for everyone

You: well

You: i am moving

You: lmao

Stranger: Emigrate to the US, you're a programmer, shouldn't be too hard to do

Stranger: Lots of space in Wisconsin lol

You: Netherlands

Stranger: Oh nice

Stranger: That's a good place too

You: lots of tech startups

You: also

Stranger: Yep

You: a degree from south africa means as much as crayon on a toilet paper

Stranger: There's a company in NL that's using one of my domain names, but hyphenated

Stranger: Lol really? Damn SA has fallen hard

You: Really hard

Stranger: Well at least with programming you can prove you know your stuff

Stranger: Do you have any stuff online?

Stranger: Like github

You: i think i took my website down

You: i hope it is

Stranger: Why?

You: an embarrasment

You: made it with a friend as we just started learning to code, looks revolting

Stranger: "hello inter net"

Stranger: Animated gifs everywhere

You: maybe not that bad

You: just very bright colors

Stranger: my-super-website.dotcom.ws

You: www.rgb-inc.co.za

You: i like the .ws

You: nice touch

Stranger: That's your website?

You: where it was

Stranger: Hmm, let me see if I can find it

You: my hosting compony took it down

You: i stopped paying

You: was to lazy to cancel subscriptions so that seemed easier

Stranger: When did you last pay for it?

You: months ago

Stranger: So you're 15 or something?

You: wayback machine?

You: yes

You: well in a month or two

Stranger: "I really sucked when I was 14, but I'm super cool now" -- 15 year old

Stranger: Hehe

Stranger: Yeah man the site says account suspended

You: ik

You: "I really sucked when I was 14, but now i dont do webdev" -- 15 year old

Stranger: Couldn't find a screenshot, looks like you're safe from embarrassment for now

Stranger: Web dev is fine, if you're good at it

You: i got like 28 visitors of all time, no screenshots

You: and i was not good at it

Stranger: What was on the website?

You: like one python script, games, misc stuff and something else

You: just all the p5.js stuff me and my friend made

Stranger: What kind of data analysis do you do?

You: mainly AI

Stranger: For your chat bot?

You: for a bunch of things

You: programmings a vice so im always working

Stranger: Programming isn't a vice

Stranger: How dare you

Stranger: You into domain names?

You: for me it is

You: i do like the occasianal domain name'

Stranger: What TLDs?

You: idk

Stranger: Googling TLD?

You: nah

Stranger: Well I guess you did have a .co.za

You: ya

Stranger: Any .com?

You: a .com was to exspensive

Stranger: It's only $9/yr

Stranger: I guess that's a lot when you're 15

You: .co.za is a once off payment

Stranger: Yeah but no one wants a .co.za

Stranger: How much is the one time payment?

You: like 3 dollars

Stranger: You sure it's one time?

You: very

Stranger: Hmm

You: lemme think

You: uhh

You: 200 rand

You: 200/14=?

You: its to late for math

You: eh

Stranger: 14.285714...

You: 14 dollars once off

Stranger: Not bad for a one time payment I guess

You: ya

Stranger: Still a very limited demand

You: very

You: if i ever make another website

Stranger: How long before SA goes full genocide?

You: oof

You: thats a good question

You: we have regular power cuts because there isnt enough electricity

Stranger: Damn, how often?

You: if you are white and drive through the wrong neighborhood you could get shot

You: its normally about 14 hours a day

Stranger: Everyone white should just leave the country, fuck that communist government

You: but in good times 4 hours

Stranger: WTF you have no power for 14 hours a day?

You: well ya

Stranger: Like wtf man, how can you cope with that shit

You: idk

Stranger: Tell your parents to move to NL or Wisconsin

You: we went through a phase where you could only use a very small amount of water a day

You: or they will come and install a restrictor

You: and we had regulat periods where they would turn off the taps

Stranger: Wtf

You: i havnnt had a power cut for a few weeks tho so they should start soonish

Stranger: Damn dude

You: racial tensions are high

You: gender based violence is off the charts

Stranger: Pretty sure that's really racial

You: so genocide/civil war could start whenever

You: one party running for president are very anti white

Stranger: Kind of hope it does, people need to fight back hard

Stranger: I'd just leave though, it seems like a lost cause

You: would remove every white person from there homes, give them to black people and put the white people in an empty home

Stranger: Fucking retarded

You: it is a lost cause

You: its so surreal tho

You: because i live in the suburbs

Stranger: Yeah you're safe for now, but man that government could go off at anytime

You: and of course there are used condoms on the floor, and hobos and beggars everywhere, it seems so calm, while i know we are on the verge of death

Stranger: So sad

You: yup

You: anyway, sorry for ranting

You: what are you working on>

Stranger: It's alright

Stranger: Making a commercial web app

You: oh ya

You: btw here is a small sample of what an AI that ive been training that makes omegle convos looks like

Stranger: Yeah I cannot read that language wtf is that

You: i dont have enough data so its not good

You: but still interesting in my opinion

You: its trying to write english omegle conversations, but failing

Stranger: Yeah

Stranger: Go to r/omegle, lots of conversations there

Stranger: Use OCR to convert the images to text

You: i though of that

You: but

You: not long enough

You: and a lot of the images have over text

You: like the omegle logo at the top

You: or overlayed text

You: and there is no omegle dataset

You: so im doing it by hand :)

Stranger: How about this

Stranger: Make a bot that uses spy mode and just copy the conversations that other people are having

You: spy mode?

Stranger: After a few days you should have a lot, some long ones too

Stranger: Yeah, aka the question mode

Stranger: Check omegle.com under the "text" button

You: ok

You: wouldnt there be alot of dirty data? bot posts and such

Stranger: Filter out the results by length, most people will disconnect on bots and spam

You: ok

You: you have to enter a question

You: but thanks

Stranger: Yeah so just use some random question, or copy real questions for a while by having multiple chats where you're the participant

You: that could work

Stranger: It will work

You: i have had every single person on spymode exiting before saying anything

Stranger: It happens a lot, but a bot won't care

You: and to get the text from the screen?

Stranger: Many ways to do it

You: it is a very interesting idea

Stranger: An easy way to get real data

You: and what would be the least ocr way of getting the text

You: it does make a lot more sense

You: less time consuming

You: less biased

Stranger: Connect at the socket level

You: i have though of having a bot record my converasations and i always thought about using netwroking

You: never thought about spymode

Stranger: It's pretty easy, a lot of people have written bots, you can probably find many on github if you want to see how it's done

You: i will look into that

You: looks promosing

You: promosing

You: its to late to spell

Stranger: Yeah man that's gibberish

You: it gets better the longer its been trained and i have it generating text at every training step\

You: BUT

You: better giberish

Stranger: It's going to be hard to create realistic text that makes sense, that way you're doing it

You: my goal isnt to make text

Stranger: Take the cleverbot approach, maybe splice it up a bit

You: im just bored

Stranger: What's the goal?

You: chatbot

You: i would do that much better

You: this is just a quick 10 min script to test the data

Stranger: It's going to be a lot of work man, especially using ML, google NLP maybe that will help or give you some leads

Stranger: Natural Language Processing

You: im looking into rasa core

You: i know what NLP is

Stranger: Not everyone does

You: its my fav field of AI

Stranger: And you're 15

Stranger: Ok

You: rasa is a NLP/chatbot framework for python

You: will work much better

You: than what im doing right now

Stranger: Anything will lol

You: thats just for entertainment

Stranger: Yeah

You: how long have you been coding?

Stranger: Since age 9

You: wow

You: and current age?

Stranger: Older than you

You: thought sp

You: first proper lang?

Stranger: First language was basic, second was assembly

You: jesus

You: thats interesting

Stranger: Yeah, took a couple of years to get into assembly though, I think I was 12

You: quite a difficult language from what ive heard

Stranger: Indeed

You: are they still used?

Stranger: But it shows you how computers work, which is very helpful in understanding computer programming

Stranger: Yeah of course, languages like C++ compile to assembly

Stranger: And languages like Python are built with C++

You: true

You: but used without being compiled into it

Stranger: What do you mean?

Stranger: Oh yeah

Stranger: But the interpreter is

Stranger: And Python has a lot of modules in C++

You: outside of interpreters/compilers do people write projects in assembl

Stranger: Yes, embedded systems, device drivers, retro game development, demoscene, etc

You: and in your life?

Stranger: Operating system, robotics, etc

You: still use them

Stranger: Do I still use assembly? Not really

You: and basic?

Stranger: No way

Stranger: I haven't used basic since like maybe 13

Stranger: Well off and on for a few years in my teens

Stranger: Got into C around then

You: ever tried java?

Stranger: Yes

You: thoughts?

You: i find people to either be strongly against it or strongly for it

Stranger: Don't like it much, there are better languages IMO for practically all domains where Java is still widely used

You: i agree

You: find it to old

You: never been rewrittwen

You: is inpractical

Stranger: I don't know about it being too old, and it doesn't really need to be rewritten, it's kind of bloated and clunky, but for some things it's fine

You: if it was rewrittwen perhaps it would be less clunky

Stranger: Yeah definitely

Stranger: But it's not going to happen, given its nature

You: never\

Stranger: I doubt it, but it could

You: is it still activley developted

Stranger: As long as they want backwards compatibility, which is why it's probably not going to happen

Stranger: Yeah

Stranger: There seems to be a bit of a resurgence in Java development lately for some reason

You: interesting

Stranger: A lot of that is probably institutionally driven, i.e. large corporations with a vested interest in it due to legacy apps

Stranger: I wouldn't use it, but it's not really a "bad" language per se, just there are better options

Stranger: What languages have you used so far?

You: python, js , java ,c++

Stranger: C++, JS and Python are my main languages

You: nice

Stranger: How old were you when you started programming?

You: 14

Stranger: And you're 15 now right?

You: no

You: in 2 months

Stranger: Ah

Stranger: So you just started programming last year then

You: maybe been 6 months

Stranger: Huh, cool man

You: thanks

Stranger: Sounds like you've explored quite a bit in that time

Stranger: Are you on github?

You: i have explored quite a bit

You: you wont find anything on my github

You: nothing im proud of to post

Stranger: Just curious if you had one, which is good

Stranger: Well consider posting some stuff, get feedback, it's a good way to improve

You: maybe

Stranger: Most programmers aren't going to give you a hard time, we were all new once

You: thats true

You: :)

Stranger: And programmers are usually cool and helpful

Stranger: Anyway dude, I'm going to get back to work now, was nice chatting with you

You: thank you for the great chat :)

You: good luck

Stranger: Yeah it was a good chat, take care
Stranger: Mornin

Stranger: I’m coding a Pokémon game right now, and I’m looking for some feedback on an idea.

You: Sure

You: Evening

Stranger: Oof

You: american?

Stranger: So I was thinking of an optional story mode, instead of a forceful one.

Stranger: And the guys laughed at the idea and denied it

Stranger: And no, not American.

You: the guys?

You: Are you with nintendo?

Stranger: omegle sucks

You: i know

Stranger: like

Stranger: a lot

Stranger: its sorta dumb

Stranger: but its good if you need someone to talk to

You: the first real person ive met in a while

Stranger: lmfao

You: to be fair

Stranger: i mean its not like we really met

You: thats true\

Stranger: but i guess its good to know theres a real person over there

You: So what do you code\

Stranger: uh

Stranger: im into cybersecurity

Stranger: and general software

You: excuse all the \'s

Stranger: mainly like algorithmic

Stranger: its fine

You: interesting

You: language?

Stranger: uh

Stranger: i use python as a crutch

Stranger: but like i know c and c++

You: i just use python

You: only been coding for 6 months

Stranger: ah

Stranger: oh really?

Stranger: wait how old are you

You: 15

You: lmao

Stranger: oh same

Stranger: USA?

You: South Africa

Stranger: oh damn

Stranger: thats far

You: very

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: what have you coded so far?

You: i mainly do AI and data analyse

Stranger: what the fuck

You: excuse the spelling

Stranger: only 6 months

You: i learn fast

Stranger: damn yea

You: im working on a AI that generates fake omegle convos

You: and maybe a chtbot

You: idk

Stranger: oh

Stranger: i made a chatbot once

Stranger: for which messaging platform

You: how did it go?

Stranger: do you wanna make it?

You: omegle bot

You: ya i wanna make it

Stranger: hm

Stranger: thatll be interesting

You: i dont wanna make a bot that sends a messsage and leaves

Stranger: yea thats toxic

You: i wanna make one that acts like a human

You: get to a point where the other person thinks its a person

Stranger: do you know what cleverbot is?

You: i do

You: sort of my goal

Stranger: yeah its pretty dope

Stranger: itll take a while

You: a long time

Stranger: natural language processing, plus parsing

You: so what method did you use with making a chatbot

Stranger: well

Stranger: you know what google hangouts is?

You: vaguely

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: so my friend, hes an adult now

Stranger: he made this framework

Stranger: https://github.com/defund/pearl

Stranger: that you can use to make hangouts bots

Stranger: with python

You: does it behave like a human?

Stranger: no

Stranger: you just make commands

You: like a discord bot

You: cool

Stranger: and it executes them when you call them

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: well theres this otherframework

Stranger: called hangoutsbot

Stranger: and you can actually make it use cleverbot

Stranger: so it speaks like a person

You: i dont have a lot of data yet so my generated conversations are pretty bad

You: Thats interesting

Stranger: lol

Stranger: if you make your bot train on omegle conversations

Stranger: it will just say "ASL"

Stranger: over and over again

You: and i dont know how im gonna get enough omegle convos

You: Lmao

Stranger: i mean

Stranger: you can just take a conversation

Stranger: like this one

Stranger: and then give it to a neural net

You: Thats what im doing

You: but i need a lot more data than one convo

Stranger: yeah exactly

Stranger: so just have a lot of conversations

Stranger: id suggest that you prevent it from saying things that are right before a disconnect

Stranger: for example, if i say bye

You: ya

Stranger: and you feed it to your bot

Stranger: your bot will say bye

Stranger: and then other person disconnect

You: so far i have 1000 lines of omegle conversation

Stranger: thats like

Stranger: a good starting amount

You: well

You: heres the text it has managed to make

Stranger: i guess what you could do is run your bot and at the same time have conversations

Stranger: lmfao

You: yup

You: so im just having chats with proggrammers and asking if i can use our convos

You: slowly building up the data

Stranger: so your making a programmer bot

Stranger: thats cool

You: well its convos will be themed around proggraming

You: because random strangers on omegle have shorter convos, and are about sex, while coding ones are long and pretty good

Stranger: yea thats true

Stranger: im really interested to see how this turns out

Stranger: maybe someday ill be on omegle and ill find a conversation with your bot

You: ill put it in a repo rn and you can check every once in a while

Stranger: that sounds litty

You: gimme a sec

Stranger: aight

You: Cool

You: lemme send the link

Stranger: ok

You: So what are you working on rn

Stranger: well

Stranger: im doing a lot of cybersecurity

Stranger: have you heard of CTF competitions

You: At the age of 15?

Stranger: well

Stranger: yeah

You: cool

You: capture the flag

You: interesting

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: you basically

Stranger: do cybersec challenges

Stranger: to get points

Stranger: and you can get money if oyu place high

You: online or in the physical world?

Stranger: online

Stranger: there are a few in person competitions

You: pretty dope

Stranger: mhm

You: so you hack things?

Stranger: yeah

You: like pen testing

You: and such

Stranger: well

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: im a crypto guy

Stranger: so like im good with my maths and encryptions

You: cryptocurrencys?

Stranger: no

Stranger: cryptography

You: ah

You: much cooler

Stranger: yea

You: i might get into that suff

Stranger: you should

You: cheers

Stranger: ill check up on the repo

Stranger: cya

You: Hey

Stranger: hi
